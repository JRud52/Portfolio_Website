          <h2>Global Game Jam</h2>
          <p>
            2012 - 2014 <br />
            While not techinically a competition, I have participated in every Global Game Jam that I was able to
            since I found out about its existance. A good mix of 2D and 3D games
            have come out of this event.

          <h2>Sudbury Game Design Compeition</h2>
          <p>
            An event that started last year, the Sudbury Game Design Competition
            brought in 15 teams in a Game Jam style of competition. The end
            products were judged by a panel of judges, and our game was awarded
            third place.

            <h2>Protolaunch</h2>
            <p>
              An event that I was able to participate in for its final year,
              Protolaunch was a series of workshops that were run on several
              weekends during the year, that brought in industry professionals
              to do a talk and then an activity with the participants. The
              summer event was the best part though. We were split up into teams
              of 4 and we each had 5 weeks to make the best game prototype that
              we possibly could make. At the end of the competition, the games
              were judged, and my team was awarded with second place.
