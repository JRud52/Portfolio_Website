                            Web apps are becoming more and more popular, and you can do almost anything with them. Seems like a good enough reason to me, to know web development.

                        2012 <br/> An event that I was able to participate in for its final year, Protolaunch was a series of workshops that were run on several weekends during the year, that brought in industry professionals to do a talk and then an
                        activity with the participants. The summer event was the best part though. We were split up into teams of 4 and we each had 5 weeks to make the best game prototype that we possibly could make. At the end of the competition, the
                        games were judged, and my team was awarded with second place.
