            <h2>Global Game Jam</h2>
            <p>
                2012 - 2014 <br /> While not techinically a competition, I have participated in every Global Game Jam that I was able to since I found out about its existance. A good mix of 2D and 3D games have come out of this event.

            <h2>Sudbury Game Design Compeition</h2>
            <p>
                An event that started last year, the Sudbury Game Design Competition brought in 15 teams in a Game Jam style of competition. The end products were judged by a panel of judges, and our game was awarded third place.

            <h2>Protolaunch</h2>
            <p>
                An event that I was able to participate in for its final year, Protolaunch was a series of workshops that were run on several weekends during the year, that brought in industry professionals to do a talk and then an activity with the participants. The
                summer event was the best part though. We were split up into teams of 4 and we each had 5 weeks to make the best game prototype that we possibly could make. At the end of the competition, the games were judged, and my team was awarded
                with second place.
