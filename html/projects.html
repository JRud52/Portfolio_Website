            Created using only html css and javascript. The visual look of the
            site conforms to the Google Material Design specification and is
            mobile responsive. It uses modern html5 and css3 techniques to
            achieve this (html5 semantic tags and flexbox positioning for example).

          <h2>Project Markdown</h2>
          <p>
            The point of this project is to create a markdown editor for students. As a computer science student myself, I wanted an application that I could use to create class-notes and study-notes that was simple and quick to use. I looked for a program that had the following necessary features:
<ul>
    <li>Cross platform
    <li>Offline storage with optional online backups to google drive/dropbox
    <li>Responsive interface that could be reconfigured based on the user's preference
    <li>Ability to switch between the editor and trhe preview easily
    <li>Ability to split the view to see both the preview and the editor
    <li>Supported extra markdown features like table of contents, tables, etc.
    <li>Custom css rules for the preview/output
    <li>export to various formats
    <li>ability to open a folder of markdown files and switch between them easily
    <li>tabbed editor to edit multiple files at once
</ul>

So far I have not been able to find an application that does everything that I want, so I decided to write my own that was geared towards students. For the student, I would like to add the following features:

  <ul>
    <li>The user may create a "Study Note" that adds the contents of each other file in the folder to it in order. Eventually the program may be able to automatically generate this file as the user creates more markdown files.
    <li>Any heading marked Lecture 1 or Chapter 1 will be added to the file in order.
    <li>The will be able to make special headings like # Definitions and have the program look for matching headings in other files. If it finds another # Definitions heading, then it will automatically add all the contents of that section to the study note.
  </ul>

          <h2>Project Nephalem</h2>
          <p>
            A project that I have been working on which will be a showcase of
            the best that I can do with web programming. It will be done with
            what I call the REALM stack.

          <h2>Project Sampson</h2>
          <p>
            This is a simple 2D game engine that I have been working on.
            Eventually I might end up implementing full 3D, but for now the
            plan is to start with 2D to get everything set up.
